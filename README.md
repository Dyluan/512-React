# React 2048 Game

A simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using React and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a web-based version of the 2048 game, built using React. The game features a 3x3 grid where players can combine tiles with the same numbers to create tiles with larger numbers. The goal is to reach the 512 tile.

## Features

- 3x3 game board
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys) for moving tiles
- Random generation of new tiles (2 or 4) after each move
- Score tracking
- Restart functionality

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles.
2. Tiles with the same number will combine into one when they touch.
3. A new tile (either 2 or 4) appears after every move.
4. Try to create a tile with the number 512!
